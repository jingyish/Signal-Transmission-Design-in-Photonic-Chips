# Introduction
In the project "photonic chips with machine learning", our team try to do some signal transmission design in photonic chips and analysed them with simulation. 
Optisystem is the simulation tool we choosed. For this software, we can see a clearly data change by Optisystem. 
Based on the properties of the WDM system and EDFA, we design the EDFA in WDM systems to optimize the gain of the transmission signal.
We combined 8 transmitter subsystems to be 8 channel WDM transmitter. A WDM system uses a multiplexer at the transmitter to join the several signals together and a demultiplexer at the receiver to split them apart.

# Background
## WDM system
Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is a fiber-optic transmission technique that combine light with different wavelengths (or colors) into one fiber, and apply with the multiplexer to transmit data. Different colors of light can travel on one fiber at the same time, then signals can be transmitted in an optical waveguide at different wavelengths or frequencies on the optical spectrum. As a result, light can transmit more information than electronics. WDM system can along with mux and demux, combine or split light with different wavelengths, then transmit data. 

## EDFA
EDFA is an optical amplifier can amplify optical signals directly without converting into electrical signals.
large gain and high output power.
Able to amplify several optical signals.

# Simulations


# Conclusion:
In this project, our ultimate goal is to use light to build some logical gate, so that people can finally use photon to replace electron to build photonics chips.
However, due to the limited time, we could not complete the logic gate of light.
Although the design is not perfect, it satisfy our primary goal. Multiple lights have been successfully combined into one fiber, and are amplified by an amplifier. 
We think this signal transmission design has been built partially successfully, because with this part light can be transmitted in long distance without high distortion.
