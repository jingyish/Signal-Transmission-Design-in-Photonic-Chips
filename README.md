## Introduction
In our project "Signal Transmission Design in Photonic chips", We self-learning the basic concepts of the photonic chips by using the graphing software, Optisystem. 
try to do some signal transmission design in photonic chips and analysed them with simulation. 
Optisystem is the simulation tool we choosed. For this software, we can see a clearly data change by Optisystem. 
Based on the properties of the WDM system and EDFA, we design the EDFA in WDM systems to optimize the gain of the transmission signal.
We combined 8 transmitter subsystems to be 8 channel WDM transmitter. A WDM system uses a multiplexer at the transmitter to join the several signals together and a demultiplexer at the receiver to split them apart.

## Background
### Photonic Chips

### WDM system
Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is a fiber-optic transmission technique that combine light with different wavelengths (or colors) into one fiber, and apply with the multiplexer to transmit data. Different colors of light can travel on one fiber at the same time, then signals can be transmitted in an optical waveguide at different wavelengths or frequencies on the optical spectrum. As a result, light can transmit more information than electronics. In this project, we apply with the schematics of the light source, along with mux and demux to build up the WDM system, which can combine or split light with different wavelengths, then transmit data. 

### EDFA (Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier)
Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA) has large gain and high output power. It is an optical amplifier that along with the doped optical fiber to amplify several  optical signals at same time. Which means EDFA can amplify optical signals directly without converting into electrical signals. In this poject, we design this signals transmission schematic combined with EDFA and WDM system. In this design, the multiplexer combine eight different signals with the pump laser, and the signals launched to the doped fiber, and the signals is amplified through the doping ions. The figure shown below is the principle schematic of EDFA system.

## Schematics

## Simulations


## Conclusion:
In this project, our ultimate goal is to use light to build some logical gate, so that people can finally use photon to replace electron to build photonics chips.
However, due to the limited time, we could not complete the logic gate of light.
Although the design is not perfect, it satisfy our primary goal. Multiple lights have been successfully combined into one fiber, and are amplified by an amplifier. 
We think this signal transmission design has been built partially successfully, because with this part light can be transmitted in long distance without high distortion.
